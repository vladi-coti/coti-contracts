/**
 * @title PrivateERC20AuditorSupplyMock
 * @notice Example (audit issue #5, “option 3”): keep {totalSupply} privacy-preserving (returns 0 in the
 *         base contract) while a **designated auditor** obtains **aggregate supply re-encrypted** to their key.
 *         The default product stance for #5 “option 1” is **documentation only** — see {PrivateERC20} and
 *         {IPrivateERC20} NatSpec for `totalSupply` / {supplyCap}; this contract illustrates an optional extension.
 * @dev Flow:
 *      1. Deploy with `auditor` = EOA (or a contract that has called `setAccountEncryptionAddress`).
 *      2. Auditor calls `setAccountEncryptionAddress` if they use a dedicated off-chain key address.
 *      3. Auditor calls `totalSupplyCiphertextForAuditor()` and decrypts off-chain — not plaintext on-chain.
 *      For testing mints, grant `MINTER_ROLE` to a test account or use a deploy script; this mock does not add a public minter.

/*
THIS IS THE 256 BIT VERSION OF PRIVATE ERC20.

Key Features:
- Full uint256 support (no scaling factors)
- AccessControl (for Bridge Integrations)
- ERC165 Support - Tokens Discoverability
- Payable Tokens with TransferAndCall (ERC677-like callback pattern)
- Encrypted Operations (Mint, Burn, Transfer, Approve)

Failure semantics (integrators and contract callers):
- State-changing operations that move value or change supply/allowances are designed to follow a
  revert-on-failure model: if the MPC layer reports that the core update did not succeed, the
  transaction reverts (enforced in {_update} for mint/transfer/burn, and via explicit requires
  where an operation composes multiple steps). Success is therefore implied by a completed call
  that did not revert. Pure/view helpers and read paths that only return ciphertext or onboarded
  values are not “success/failure” token operations in that sense.

Storage encoding ({_safeOnboard} — see implementation NatSpec):
- Uninitialized or zeroed `ctUint256` slots read as both 128-bit limbs zero. The implementation
  treats that as **canonical empty** and maps it to `MpcCore.setPublic256(0)` without calling
  `MpcCore.onBoard` (gas). Any other pattern is onboarded with `MpcCore.onBoard`.
- Successful updates in this contract only write ciphertext via `MpcCore.offBoard` after MPC
  success, so balances, allowances, and aggregate supply stay consistent with the precompile.

Trust assumptions (deploy only when these hold):
- Deploy only on chains where the MPC precompile at address(0x64) is part of the trusted base.
  You explicitly trust that network: its consensus, node/precompile implementation, and upgrade
  policy. All balances and transfers are ultimately defined by MPC results this contract cannot
  independently verify. If the precompile were malicious or buggy, accounting integrity could fail
  in ways Solidity cannot fix on-chain. Optional mitigations (e.g. admin pause, monitoring) only
  limit further damage after suspicion; they do not prove past MPC correctness or roll back state.
  If the chain allows precompile upgrades, consider monitoring and circuit-breakers.
- There is **no** trust-minimized substitute on-chain: auditors and integrators should record which
  chain ID, precompile address, and build/version they rely on, and treat MPC upgrades as **trusted**
  migrations unless your organization runs independent off-chain verification against published specs.
- MINTER_ROLE must only pass valid amounts to mint/mintGt/mint(itUint256). If the MPC layer
  enforces bounds or validity, that dependency applies.
- Minting is bounded by {supplyCap} (override in concrete tokens like {decimals}); enforced in {_update}.
- Integrators — {totalSupply} vs supply: the default {totalSupply} returns 0 and does **not** reflect
  circulating aggregate supply (see {totalSupply} NatSpec). Do not plug this token into protocols that
  assume ERC-20 `totalSupply` semantics. Use {supplyCap} only as the **mint ceiling** parameter; for
  actual supply, use off-chain indexing or a dedicated extension (e.g. auditor reencryption mocks).
- Gas: multiple precompile calls per transfer/approve; no unbounded loops. Document expected
  gas ranges for common operations if needed for integrators.
- Reentrancy: balance/allowance-changing entry points use nonReentrant so a transferAndCall
  receiver cannot nest transferFrom/transfer/approve/increaseAllowance/decreaseAllowance/mint/burn in the same transaction.
- transferAndCall: public-amount overload uses {ITokenReceiver}; encrypted-amount overload uses
  {ITokenReceiverEncrypted} (no plaintext amount in callback). Receivers are still fully trusted
  for callback behavior.

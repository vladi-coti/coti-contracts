/**
 * @dev Interface of the COTI Private ERC-20 standard.
 *
 * Trust assumptions (MPC — read before deploying or integrating):
 * - Confidential balances, allowances, and transfer arithmetic are executed via `MpcCore` and the
 *   chain’s MPC precompile. This interface does not specify a verification layer: **token accounting
 *   ultimately follows whatever the precompile returns.** Solidity cannot re-prove MPC soundness on-chain.
 * - Deploying or holding this token means accepting **trust in the network operator**, consensus,
 *   precompile implementation, versioning, and any upgrade path that may replace or alter MPC behavior.
 * - Operational controls on the token (e.g. pausing, roles, supply caps) **contain** misuse or
 *   incident response; they do **not** substitute for MPC trust and cannot roll back or audit past
 *   precompile outputs cryptographically.
 * - Client-side encryption (ciphertext formats, AES keys, wallet/SDK behavior) must stay consistent
 *   with the chain’s MPC expectations; malformed or adversarial off-chain inputs are not fully
 *   recoverable by the contract alone.
 * - **Canonical empty ciphertext:** an all-zero `ctUint256` in storage (uninitialized or cleared)
 *   is read as numeric **zero** using the implementation’s `_safeOnboard` shortcut (`setPublic256(0)`
 *   without an extra `onBoard` round-trip). Any other bit pattern is onboarded via `MpcCore.onBoard`.
 *   Do not rely on writing raw ciphertext to token storage outside the implementation’s normal
 *   `offBoard` paths unless it matches MPC encoding rules.
 *
 * Failure semantics: implementations are expected to use a revert-on-failure model for
 * balance/supply/allowance-changing operations. If the MPC layer reports failure for a core
 * update, the call reverts unless otherwise noted. View/pure reads are not token "operations"
 * in that sense. Encrypted boolean (`gtBool`) is not used as a return type on this interface;
 * success is indicated by the transaction completing without revert.
 *
 * Supply and {totalSupply} (integration rule — read before integrating):
 * - {totalSupply} in the reference implementation does **not** return circulating aggregate supply.
 *   It is not a substitute for standard ERC-20 `totalSupply` in vaults, oracles, or pro-rata logic.
 * - For the **maximum mintable** amount (ceiling), use {supplyCap} and the enforcement described in
 *   the implementation’s `_update` / mint path — not {totalSupply}.
 * - For **actual** aggregate supply, use off-chain indexing, a privileged operational dashboard,
 *   or a concrete extension that exposes encrypted supply to designated parties (see project mocks
 *   such as `PrivateERC20AuditorSupplyMock`).

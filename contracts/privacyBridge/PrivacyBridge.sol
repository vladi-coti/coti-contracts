/**
 * @title PrivacyBridge
 * @notice Base contract for Privacy Bridge contracts containing common logic
 * @dev Trust assumptions: (1) MPC precompile at expected address is correct and non-malicious.
 *      (2) Private token implementation is trusted and only authorized minters can mint.
 *      (3) Pause and rescue (governance-critical): The owner can {pause}. While paused, derived bridges expose
 *          owner-only rescue entry points ({PrivacyBridgeCotiNative.rescueNative}, {PrivacyBridgeERC20.rescueERC20})
 *          that send value to {rescueRecipient}. Those calls can transfer the contract's entire relevant balance,
 *          including liquidity that backs user obligations (full TVL migration). That is the intended emergency
 *          response after a bug or to retire a deployment; it is not enforced user-by-user on-chain. Treat
 *          owner key compromise after pause as catastrophic TVL loss to {rescueRecipient}. Mitigations are
 *          operational: multisig or timelock on ownership, strict {rescueRecipient} policy, monitoring of
 *          {Paused} and rescue events, and separation of duties where possible.
 *      (4) Oracle prices are trusted; {maxOracleAge} bounds staleness of `lastUpdated` (owner cannot set it to zero;
 *          use a large value only if a very lenient window is intended). Does not remove oracle trust.
 *      (5) {totalUserLiability} is bridge bookkeeping for transparency: it tracks net user obligations from mint/burn
 *          paths in this contract only. It helps depositors/observers reason about exposure; it is not a
 *          cryptographic proof of MPC/private-token balances and can diverge if the token layer misbehaves.
 *          **Docs / integrators:** Compare this counter to collateral still held by *this* contract (ERC20:
 *          {PrivacyBridgeERC20.token} balance; native: {address(this).balance}) for a liquidity snapshot. After
 *          {rescueERC20}/{rescueNative}, collateral may sit at {rescueRecipient} while this counter is unchanged—
 *          economic claims on outstanding private supply are not extinguished by rescue; do not treat the counter
 *          as “assets on hand” post-migration. Forced native (e.g. `selfdestruct`) increases balance but **never**
 *          mints private tokens and does **not** increase {totalUserLiability} (no user deposit path).
 *      (6) For COTI-operated deployments, residual trust in MPC/private-token behavior beyond (2) and (5), and in oracle
 *          *market* correctness beyond (4), is an accepted operational assumption; the on-chain mitigations above
 *          are the intended scope for those concerns in this module.
 *      (7) **Centralized control:** A single `Ownable` owner and any `OPERATOR_ROLE` grantees can configure pause,
 *          oracle rotation, deposit/withdraw limits, blacklist, and fee *parameters* (floors/caps/percentages) exposed
 *          in this module. **Fee and rescue destinations are fixed at deployment**—there are no setters for
 *          {feeRecipient} or {rescueRecipient}, so a compromised owner **cannot** redirect rescue or fee sweep
 *          addresses to an attacker (trade-off: a wrong address at deploy or a reverting recipient must be handled
 *          operationally / via migration). {transferOwnership} enumerates and revokes all role members, which can
 *          become gas-heavy with many operators; that cost is accepted. The contracts are not upgradeable via
 *          delegatecall within this package. Operational mitigations are off-chain: multisig or timelock on
 *          ownership, least-privilege operators, and monitoring.
 *      (8) **Oracle binding:** {_validateOracleTimestamps} requires exact equality to the user-supplied Band row
 *          timestamps so the fee quote cannot change between estimate and execution without a revert. With a
 *          typical ~30 minute feed cadence (plus {maxOracleAge} buffer), users have ample time to sign and submit
 *          the same row; relaxing this binding is intentionally rejected to avoid showing one price and settling
 *          at another.
